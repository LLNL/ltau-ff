Trained (TorchScript-compiled) models for all three datasets are provided here,
along with their corresponding training set descriptors and observed
uncertainties. Note that in order to reduce the size of the repo, only a single
model for each dataset is provided, even though ensembles were trained for
`3BPA` and `Carbon_GAP_20`. If you are interested in obtaining the full
ensembles, please contact us.

The descriptors for the `OC20` dataset are not provided due to their large size,
but can be re-computed using the provided
[ltau-ff-nequip-descriptors](https://lc.llnl.gov/gitlab/vita1/ltau-ff/-/blob/main/scripts/ltau-ff-nequip-descriptors?ref_type=heads)
script.
